[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was about the different ways that you could formulate tabular data with forms and tables. It's pretty
unique that you're able to code in a table inside of a form, so that you can have multiple ways of taking in user input. It'll be super interesting to see
how we're able to connect all this front-end work with the back-end. I think it'll be something that will be challenging but will be super fun to deal with.

The hardest thing in this assignment was the start of the assignment. It was a bit rough for me to understand what we were supposed to be doing. However, after
realizing that CSS was fully for style, it was then understood that with anything related to style, I would put off until our CSS assignment. Things sailed
smoothly afterwards because I was able to use the knowledge from class to go through the different phases rather quickly. However, phase 5 still throws me off
a little bit and I've taken a bit more time to thoroughly make sure that I did phase 5 correctly as opposed to the other phases.
