- [X] Phase 3

I discussed this assignment with:

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how flexboxes worked. It was interesting realizing that you could organize text from left to right and have multiple text on the
same line but within different slots because of flexbox's use of justify or align. Having to realize how to swap around between those two was interesting to learn.

The hardest thing in this assignment was something that really frustrated me the most (phase 5). It was difficult because I had profile on the far right of the nav bar, but it was hard to move
it back to the right after i fixed the flexible flex boxes and stuff. But, I think that I left it for now and will get help on how to fix it after the assignment is due.
