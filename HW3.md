----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 1
- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [X] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- Anthony Provezano -- helped me debug some of my issues with github autograder

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was about how to use DJango for dynamic programming within HTML. Since this is my first time writing in HTML, CSS, and using DJango,
it was interesting to be able to take information from the backend of a site and to upload it into the front-end. This is something that will stick with me and will be used through many
of the different programs that I look forward to making in the future.

The hardest thing in this assignment was URLs for sure. I was having a lot of trouble linking different URLs to each other because I would have things like /1/index.html instead of directly
going into /index.html. It is something of a struggle for me and something that I will continue having issues with.
