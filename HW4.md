In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 1
- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [ started ] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- Anthony Provenzano

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was about rendering vs redirecting.
It was definitely cool to learn about the different ways to redirect and render and why you should use each
Rendering when there are mainly no changes and redirecting when you want to completely go back to a newURL was super interesting as well.

The hardest thing in this assignment was definitely phase 3. I had so many troubles when I was going through this part
with the errors checking. It was frustring to learn that the main reason that I was struggling is because
I had set type="number" and min/max in the HTML FILE itself so that the brwoser would be doing its own check.
This was somethign that had me stumped for a while and i spent a lot more time than I definitely needed on this assignment itself.
