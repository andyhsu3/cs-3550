[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was defnitely the security checks. Having to realize that when you're creating your own browser, you have to
keep track of all these different checks to make sure your site is secure was fascinating. I think it's most interesting to think that we've really only touched
on it just a little and that there are still a lot of security checks that we could perform.

The hardest thing in this assignment was definitely Phase 3. I think that I struggled the most with computing the grades, getting that to work, and then when it finally worked
to show up on the profile page. It was hard to get everything to flow, and this was definitely the area that i struggled on the most. I did not find the security checks to be
as hard as I thought they would have, but computing grades really kicked my ass.
