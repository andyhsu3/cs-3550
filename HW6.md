[X] I solemnly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was about JQuery in general. It was my first time using Javascript / JQuery and it was interesting to read up on the documentation and learn about how to tie this in
with html to make a more dynamic website.

The hardest thing in this assignment was definitely phase 4 with the error checking. I was (and still am) unsure
if I'm actually doing the assignments wrong honestly because in the previous HW, we made it so you can only submit
pdf files. (i tried to check by submitting txt files and had no pdf that was too large).
